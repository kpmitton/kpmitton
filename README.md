- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kpmitton
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in vision science and I am a vision scientist, an Associate Professor of Biomedical Sciences at Oakland University in Rochester Michigan.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to become more and more independent doing analysis of our NGS sequencing data, where we look for the genetic cause of some very rare
 (orphan) pediatric retinal diseases. Rather than just relying on tools and workflows that come with our Illumina DNA sequencer, I like to run the process on 
 our own computers and teach my staff and student what is under the hood. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that seek to find the causes of Norrie Disease, FEVR (Familial Exudative VitreoRetinopathy), and Retinoschisis in
persons with these blinding diseases.
- I am also interested the applications of big data analysis using AI to predict potential contibutions of multigenic (many different gene) variants to a disease
 phenotype.

- I keep a general information personal website at: http://kenmitton.com  which links to the secure website https://kenmitton.wordpress.com
